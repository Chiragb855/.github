### *Engineer • System Thinker • Explorer of chaotic ideas*

I like building things that feel alive. Not just “working code,” but systems that breathe—fast, precise, and quietly elegant. My work sits somewhere between engineering discipline and artistic chaos, where clarity fights entropy and usually wins.

I explore circuits, color spaces, psychology, and software architecture the same way some people explore forests. Everything is a puzzle worth poking.

## 🧠 **What drives my work**

Performance makes me smile.
Clarity keeps me honest.
Expression keeps me curious.

I’m obsessed with minimal, handcrafted systems—no bulky stacks, no unnecessary dependencies, just clean logic and steady refinement. Every project I ship tries to answer one question:

**Can engineering and art shake hands without making things messy?**

## 🛠️ **Tech & tools I enjoy**

* **C++20/23** — templates, systems, performance engineering
* **JavaScript / HTML / CSS** — handcrafted, framework-free builds
* **TypeScript** — when strict structure feels right
* **Color science** — CAM models, tone mapping, gamut logic
* **Algorithm design** — linalg, optimization, text ranking
* **System architecture** — modular, predictable, scalable
* **Generative design & AI tooling**

I build from scratch not because it’s heroic, but because it teaches me things that shortcuts hide.

## 🎯 **What I’m really trying to build**

Not a company.
Not a product line.
Something stranger and more personal:

**A software empire of ideas.**

A connected ecosystem of tools, art, systems, and thoughts—all sharpening each other.

Also, yes—I call myself an idiot occasionally. That’s just my way of staying teachable.
