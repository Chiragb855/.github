# **🌟 Chirag Bansal — Engineer, Explorer, System Thinker**

I’m someone who can’t sit still in a single lane. My mind keeps wandering into circuits, colors, algorithms, psychology, and sometimes into pure chaos just to see what falls out.
I build things that try to make sense of that chaos — fast systems, clean designs, and expressive tools that feel alive.

Performance matters to me. Clarity matters even more. Every project I touch becomes a playground for structure, precision, and expression. I like the kind of puzzles where engineering hugs art and neither wants to let go.

## **🧩 What I’m Currently Building**

### **💡 LEACB (Let’s Explore About Chirag Bansal)**

My personal home on the internet — a one-page hub for everything I create.
Fast, minimal, hand-coded HTML/CSS/JS.
A digital identity shaped around curiosity, performance, and expression.

### **🎨 Auric Artisan**

My artistic side — printable art, covers, stickers, and tiny design experiments.
A combination of color psychology, aesthetic theory, and playful visuals.
A small universe of beauty built one asset at a time.

### **🎛️ Crygraphyx**

Where my precision lives.
This is where I build highly optimized tools — from color science experiments to display calibration logic to advanced utility libraries.
The lab where performance is king and clarity is religion.

### **📘 Life & Verity**

A place for thought — structured writing, explanations, and clarity-driven essays.
I explore psychology, cognition, patterns, and the machinery of human behavior.

### **🎨 Couleur Verse**

A creative space for color exploration, palettes, gradients, and visual harmony.
This is where engineering meets art with no rules and no boundaries.

## **🛠️ Tech I Play With (and obsess over)**

* **C++ (C++20/23)** — templates, systems, performance-heavy logic
* **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** — scratch-built websites, no frameworks
* **TypeScript** — when the project deserves strictness
* **Color science**, HDR workflows, tone mapping, linalg
* **System architecture**, high-performance algorithms
* **Generative design**, AI-assisted creation, creative tooling

I like building things “from scratch” — even when the world says "use a library."
The fun is in understanding every layer.

## **🔭 My Philosophy**

I see myself as an engineer shaped by curiosity and a creator shaped by discipline.
Systems excite me. Colors calm me. Music resets me.
I’m trying to build an ecosystem — not a company or product — but a **software empire of ideas**.

And yes, I like calling myself an idiot sometimes. Not as an insult, but as a reminder that learning never stops.
